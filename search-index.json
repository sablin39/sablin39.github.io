Don’t take it seriously. While male with ADHD often have noticeable symptoms like hyperactivity or disruptive behavior, females with ADHD are often characterized by inattention, forgetfulness, and internalized behaviors (e.g., anxiety, depression). This can lead to females being overlooked or misdiagnosed with other conditions like anxiety or depression. Interestingly, symptoms observed from transgender individuals can be consistent with their gender identity even before Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Effects of Female HormonesThe change of estrogen and progesterone is highly related to ADHD symptoms. The symptoms are consistent with menstrual cycle, making it more acute when experiencing premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Effects for hyperactivity-impulsivity appeared mainly driven by declines in estrogen regardless of levels of progesterone, consistent with more of an ovulatory effect. In contrast, inattentive effects were driven by declines in estrogen but were moderated by levels of progesterone.1 In the follicular phase, which is the period when estrogen levels are steadily increasing, ADHD symptoms are at their lowest. 2 While ADHD risk appears to be highest for males during the prenatal period, females experience heightened risk during multiple reproductive periods. Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the impact of hormones and environmental stressors. This may lead to a structural change in brain, causing a rising possibility of triggering ADHD symptoms. Evidences shown that many female individuals are diagnosed after adolescence, while they may have minimal or no symptoms suggesting ADHD. Interestingly, transgender female may be diagnosed as adult ADHD after they started Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). Changes in response to ADHD medications likely reflect the point in the menstrual cycle that a woman is and where all these different hormones are. In practice, clinicians may adjust medication and even add additional medication to help women manage their ADHD and period-related exacerbations. Hormonal changes at puberty — especially the higher levels of estrogen and progesterone — can cause ADHD medications to be less effective. Studies have shown that estrogen may enhance a woman’s response to amphetamine medications, but this effect may be diminished in the presence of progesterone.3 Additionally, The loss of estrogen leads to a decrease in serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain leads to a higher rate of moodiness, sadness, irritability, fatigue, fuzzy thinking, and memory lapses.4 A combination of HRT with ADHD medication often improves symptoms most effectively. Effects of TestosteroneADHD exhibits a prominent sex-biased prevalence rate in childhood with a 3:1 ratio favoring boys. 5 Testosterone plays a crucial role in attention, focus, and inhibitory control, functions that are often impaired in ADHD. However, studies also suggest that testosterone supplementation may alleviate some symptoms, such as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Cognitive control was impaired in girls with mild and severe ADHD (Inattentive and Combined subtypes of ADHD), but only in boys with severe ADHD (Combined ADHD subtype), suggesting that girls needed more severe impairment in order to exhibit symptoms. 6 A steady testosterone level leads to improved focus, better emotional regulation, and increased body strength.8 This is obviously beneficial to ADHD symptoms since the major way to reduce the effect of ADHD is Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and exercise. High testosterone level may worsen hyperactive and impulsive symptoms, leading ADHD boys being “too energetic” but easier to be discovered and diagnosed. Hypothesis suggests that prenatal testosterone exposure may have potential effects on ADHD symptoms. A survey conducted by 7 indicated that higher fetal testosterone levels may play a role, not only in the origin of autism, but also in the aetiology of PDD-NOS and of ADHD&#x2F;ODD. Males with anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal testosterone levels. Evidence from Turner’s Syndrome also suggests that higher testosterone:estrogen ratios relate to cognitive control problems similar to those seen in ADHD. Symptoms of Transgender Individuals No reliable resources available. Changes in hormones during puberty is also vital for brain circuitry development. For example, several types of reproductive and social behaviors (e.g., sexual behavior, scent marking, social interactions) are impaired in male rodents if they are castrated before puberty.9 These changes may result in organizational effects on the brain, and hormone replacement in adulthood does not reverse these deficits. 8 Transgender indivudals are reported to have a higher rate of having ADHD, ASD than their peers, which may resulted from social pressure or changes in hormone levels. The link between sex hormones to ADHD symptoms is still not clear, it can effect structural development of brain during puberty and controls our daily behaviors. Even hormone exposure levels during pregnancy may be a vital factor. Most of the effects presented are just having “correlation” instead of “causality” with hormones. To sum up, DO NOT mess up any medication for any reason.

In this post, we will dive into its training paradigm and its inference implementation. Code link:  Paper link:  Update on 2025&#x2F;04&#x2F;10:Though this model is quite suck compared with GRPO+SFT pipeline as Deepseek-R1, its token-level value inside MCTS is quite interesting. This may potentially be a trick for pretraining small langugage model of different structure than GPT. A token-level reward formulation like this is easy to be derived since it shares the same formulation as perplexity during pretraining. However, it offers too much uncessary information in SFT stage and may cause instability.Always be open to new ideas and value possibilities. No one knows the value of an infant. Training ParadigmMacro-o1 adopts full-param SFT using existing CoT datasets by OpenAI and synthetic dataset generated by open source LLM. Compared with previous SFT, a CoT dataset provides a linear path for LLM to follow, while LLM can also explore other action nodes for exploration. This may lead to a balance between exploration and exploitation, significantly reduces the distribution shift caused by bias within dataset. MCTS Revisit Selection: Start from root R and select successive child nodes until a leaf node L is reached. The root is the current game state and a leaf is any node that has a potential child from which no simulation (playout) has yet been initiated. The section below says more about a way of biasing choice of child nodes that lets the game tree expand towards the most promising moves, which is the essence of Monte Carlo tree search. Expansion: Unless L ends the game decisively (e.g. win&#x2F;loss&#x2F;draw) for either player, create one (or more) child nodes and choose node C from one of them. Child nodes are any valid moves from the game position defined by L. Simulation: Complete one random playout from node C. This step is sometimes also called playout or rollout. A playout may be as simple as choosing uniform random moves until the game is decided (for example in chess, the game is won, lost, or drawn). Backpropagation: Use the result of the playout to update information in the nodes on the path from C to R. Training ProceduresIn the training procedure, “action” is formulated as LLM outputs, or to say, the fixed-length tokens {ti}i=1N\\{t_i\\}^N_{i=1}{ti​}i=1N​. Then the value of each state is obtained by applying the softmax function to its log probability and the log probabilities of the top 5 alternative tokens. ci=exp⁡(p(ti))∑k=15exp⁡(p(tk)) c_i=\\frac{\\exp(p(t_i))}{\\sum^5_{k=1}\\exp(p(t_k))} ci​=∑k=15​exp(p(tk​))exp(p(ti​))​ Here p(ti)p(t_i)p(ti​) is the log probability of token generated by LLM, and p(tk)p(t_k)p(tk​) denotes the top kkk predicted tokens at step iii. Thus the reward of a state is obtained as: v=1N∑i=1Nci v=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum^N_{i=1}c_i v=N1​i=1∑N​ci​ Dataset PreparationBesides Open-O1 dataset, they also built a synthetic dataset using MCTS. An example of CoT data is provided in CoT_demo.json . It’s generated by Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct using the above value formulation for tree search. InferenceMacro-o1 has a vllm implementation based on Qwen2Model. Compared with original Qwen structure, it adds a generate_response function above model’s forward instead of directly use model.generate(). The following is huggingface implementation, which is more detailed than vllm ones. Such generation process exposes the logits of tokens to achieve the above MCTS procedures. Such token-level, or to say, logit-level value formulation is quite interesting and can be seen as a successor of sampling methods like beam search.

Here we have the score function as: sθ(x[k],x[k−1],u[k−1])=sθ(x)=∇xlog⁡pθ(x)=−∇xEθ(x) s_\\theta (x[k],x[k−1],u[k−1])=s_\\theta(\\mathbf x) = \\nabla_{\\mathbf x} \\log p_\\theta(\\mathbf x)=-\\nabla_{\\mathbf x} E_\\theta(\\mathbf x) sθ​(x[k],x[k−1],u[k−1])=sθ​(x)=∇x​logpθ​(x)=−∇x​Eθ​(x) Dataset: A set of transitions {(xi[k−1],ui[k−1],xi[k])}i=1N\\{(x_i[k-1], u_i[k-1], x_i[k])\\}^N_{i=1}{(xi​[k−1],ui​[k−1],xi​[k])}i=1N​ with “independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)” assumption.

A Lagrangian is a function which summarizes the dynamics of the entire system. The non-relativistic Lagrangian for a system of particles in the absence of an electromagnetic field is given by L=T−V L=T-V L=T−V where TTT denotes total kinetic energy of the system and VVV denotes the total potential energy, reflecting the energy of interaction between the particles. The optimization target is to minimize LLL Lagrange’s Equations for a time varying system with number of constraints being CCC .

He originally termed this energy as the “available energy” in a system. His paper “Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids” published in 1873 outlined how his equation could predict the behavior of systems when they are combined. This quantity is the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work, and is the sum of its enthalpy HHH and the product of the temperature TTT and the entropy SSS of the system.

Energy Based ModelUsing divergence measure as metrics cannot deal with futures with multiple possibilities (e.g. Multiple solutions in path planning). The average of all possibilities will possibly be the optimal result in such metrics, overfitting may also occur for datasets of insufficient samples. We can replace the divergence measure with an energy function, which measures the “incompatibility” between xxx and yyy. the compatible solution can be inferred using gradient descent, heruistic search etc. Now the target becomes “Finding an output satisfying the constraints”. An unconditional EBM F(y)F(y)F(y) measures the compatibility between components of yyy. For a conditional EBM F(x,y)F(x,y)F(x,y), we have low energy near provided data points, while higher energy for everywhere else. (PS. This optimization is in inference process) y^=arg⁡min⁡yF(x,y) \\hat y = \\arg\\min_y F(x,y) y^​=argymin​F(x,y) As a visualization: Probabilistic models are a special case of EBM. Energies are like un-normalized negative log probabilities 1 . If we want to turn energy functions as distributions, we can use Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, which adopts maximum entropy approach and Gibbs formula. P(y∣x)=e−βF(x,y)∫y′e−βF(x,y′) P(y|x)=\\frac{e^{-\\beta F(x,y)}}{\\int_{y&#x27;}e^{-\\beta F(x,y&#x27;)}} P(y∣x)=∫y′​e−βF(x,y′)e−βF(x,y)​ β\\betaβ is a positive constant. However the normalization constant at denominator is often intractable. One possible solution is to learn the log-likelihood of P(y∣x)P(y|x)P(y∣x) , and the distribution is changed into ∇ylog⁡P(y∣x)=−βF(x,y)−∇ylog⁡∫y′e−βF(x,y′)⏞≈0 \\nabla_y \\log P(y|x)=-\\beta F(x,y)-\\overbrace{\\nabla_y \\log {\\int_{y&#x27;}e^{-\\beta F(x,y&#x27;)}}}^{\\approx 0} ∇y​logP(y∣x)=−βF(x,y)−∇y​log∫y′​e−βF(x,y′)​≈0​ EBM for Multi-Modal ScenariosJoint Embedding For the above example, the energy function is trained with the similarity of xxx and yyy . There may exist multiple unseen yyy that has the same xxx , and we may quantify those unseen yyy by projecting them into the invariant subspace of latent yyy. Latent Generative EBM Ideally the latent variable represents the independent explanatory factors of variation of prediction. But since it’s unobservable, information capacity of latent variable must be minimized. We may also see it as a “bias”, or a placeholder for uncertainties. The inference can be formulated as: y^,z^=arg⁡min⁡y,zE(x,y,z) \\hat y, \\hat z = \\arg \\min_{y,z} E(x,y,z) y^​,z^=argy,zmin​E(x,y,z) However the latent variable is not presented and cannot be measured in supervised manner. So we will have to minimize its effect. F∞(x,y)=min⁡zE(x,y,z) F_\\infty (x,y) = \\min_z E(x,y,z) F∞​(x,y)=zmin​E(x,y,z) FFF is a free energy model and constrained on \"temperature\" term β\\betaβ as previously shown in Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution. In practice, β\\betaβ can be a variance schedule (eg. DDPM). Fβ=−1βlog⁡∫ze−βE(x,y,z) F_\\beta =-\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\log \\int_z e^{-\\beta E(x,y,z)} Fβ​=−β1​log∫z​e−βE(x,y,z) y^=arg⁡min⁡yF(x,y) \\hat y =\\arg \\min_y F(x,y) y^​=argymin​F(x,y) If we try to understand this in a causal approach, we can treat zzz as a unobserved confounder, which causes a biased estimation of the effect of xxx on EEE. P(E∣do(x))≠P(E∣x) P(E|\\mathrm{do}(x)) \\neq P(E|x) P(E∣do(x))=P(E∣x) This do(⋅)\\mathrm{do}(\\cdot)do(⋅) operator means an intervention (or call it adjustment) of xxx. The intervention cannot “back-propagate” to confounder thus the result is changed. The “adjust formula” provides an unbiased solution by taking all zzz into consideration. However the domain of zzz is often intractable and we need to regularize it so it’s small enough to neglect. P(E∣do(x))=∫zP(E∣x,z)P(z) P(E|\\mathrm{do}(x)) = \\int_z P(E|x,z)P(z) P(E∣do(x))=∫z​P(E∣x,z)P(z) On the contrary, we can also examine the robustness of EEE with sensitivity analysis. This connects to the concept of “quantify the uncertainty of unseen yyy by projecting them into the invariant subspace of latent yyy“ mentioned above. For those may be interested: Sensitivity analysis of such EBM: *For simplicity, we directly write xxx for Pred(x)\\mathrm{Pred}(x)Pred(x) . * If we treat the above generative EBM as a causal graph, assuming linear relationship among variables (non-linear scenes will be derived in the following posts), we will have: &gt;{&gt;&gt;Dec=αxx+αzz&gt;C=βxx+βzz+βyy+δDec&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \\left\\{ &gt; \\begin{aligned} &gt; \\mathrm{Dec}&amp;=\\alpha_x x+\\alpha_z z \\\\ &gt; C&amp;=\\beta_x x + \\beta_z z +\\beta_y y+\\delta \\mathrm{Dec} &gt; \\end{aligned} &gt; \\right. &gt; &gt;{&gt;&gt;Dec&gt;C​=αx​x+αz​z=βx​x+βz​z+βy​y+δDec&gt;​&gt;&gt; We can obtain the confounding bias by adjusting xxx, leading to different y^\\hat yy^​, and gets confounding bias: &gt;Bias=αzβz&gt; &gt; \\mathrm{Bias}=\\frac{\\alpha_z}{\\beta_z} &gt; &gt;Bias=βz​αz​​&gt; The Average total Effect (ATE) of zzz on CCC is as &gt;dCdz=∂C∂y∂y∂z+&gt;∂C∂y^∂y^∂z=δ+Bias&gt; &gt; \\frac{\\mathrm d C}{\\mathrm dz} = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial {y}} \\frac{\\partial {y}}{\\partial {z}}+ &gt; \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial {\\hat y}} \\frac{\\partial {\\hat y}}{\\partial {z}} = \\delta+\\mathrm{Bias} &gt; &gt;dzdC​=∂y∂C​∂z∂y​+&gt;∂y^​∂C​∂z∂y^​​=δ+Bias&gt; By assuming the distribution of zzz, we can derive the uncertainty of y^\\hat yy^​ by “propagating”. &gt;Var(y^)=(∂y^∂z)2Var(z)+&gt;(∂y^∂x)2Var(x)+&gt;2∂y^∂x∂y^∂zCov(z,x)&gt; &gt; \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat y) = (\\frac{\\partial {\\hat y}}{\\partial {z}})^2\\mathrm{Var}(z) + &gt; (\\frac{\\partial {\\hat y}}{\\partial {x}})^2\\mathrm{Var}(x) + &gt; 2\\frac{\\partial {\\hat y}}{\\partial {x}} \\frac{\\partial {\\hat y}}{\\partial {z}} \\mathrm{Cov}(z,x) &gt; &gt;Var(y^​)=(∂z∂y^​​)2Var(z)+&gt;(∂x∂y^​​)2Var(x)+&gt;2∂x∂y^​​∂z∂y^​​Cov(z,x)&gt; We can use the Fisher Information, which is defined to be the variance of the score function, to further state the uncertainty. This will come in the next post that provides a more detailed formulation of score function and EBM. Training of EBMShape F(x,y)F(x,y)F(x,y) so that: F(x[i],y[i])F(x[i], y[i])F(x[i],y[i]) is strictly smaller than F(x[i],y)F(x[i], y)F(x[i],y) for all yyy different from y[i]y[i]y[i]. Keep FFF smooth.

A recommended reading order is: Notes on “The Energy-Based Learning Model” by Yann LeCun, 2021 Learning Data Distribution Via Gradient Estimation From MPC to Energy-Based Policy How Would Diffusion Model Help Robot Imitation Causality hidden in EBM Diffusion Process Revisiting We can start from the target functions of DDPM.

This can be inferred from q(xt∣xt−1)q(x_t|x_{t-1})q(xt​∣xt−1​) based on its markov chain property. The optimization target of network θ\\thetaθ is formulated as predicting the noise added in the forward process at different noise levels. For example, KL(ϵk,ϵθ(x0+ϵk,k))\\mathrm {KL}(\\epsilon^k, \\epsilon_\\theta(x^0+\\epsilon^k, k))KL(ϵk,ϵθ​(x0+ϵk,k)) , where ϵk\\epsilon^kϵk denotes noise generated with noise level kkk. And if we want to add condition for the model, we can simply use these conditions with cross attention on noise predictors. Paradigm: Learning Distribution by Estimating GradientsIt’s easy for researchers to come out the idea that the conditional observation-action distribution P(At∣Ot)P(A_t | O_t)P(At​∣Ot​) can also be learned by estimation gradients of data distribution, which is a common paradigm of RL and IL. Implicit Policy LearningScore-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations states that, for score matching, it’s reversing a “variance exploding” SDE where more and more noise is added to data, while diffusion models are reversing a “variance preserving” SDE that interpolates between the data and a fixed variance gaussian. Stochastic Sampling and Initialization Intuitively, multi-modality in action generation for diffusion policy arises from two sources – an underlying stochastic sampling procedure and a stochastic initialization. Trajectory Generation with Diffusion ModelsPeople have been dreaming of using video or scene generation model as “world model” to guide robot planning. However, most of the information in a video frame, even for those captured in real scenarios are highly redundant for the oriented task. In need of a unified representation of states and actions among different training sets, especially visual training sets like Internet videos, trajectory, as a time-dependent elegant modal, is adopted by multiple works, its generation with diffusion is also a low-hanging fruit.

Map the estimated articulation model of each object from the global frame. The set of these articulation models constitutes the scene-level articulation model MMM. Modules-In detailAffordance Prediction Estimation based on PointNet++[2] The prediction problem is modeled as a binary classification problem. The observation point cloud is fed into PointNet++ to get a point-wise affordance map. Exploration driven training: We first uniformly sample locations over the surface of both articulated and non-articulated parts, then have the robot interact with them. If the robot successfully moves any articulated part of theobjects, we label the corresponding location as positive affordances or negative otherwise. To simulate gripper-based interactions, we perform a collision check at each location to ensure enough space for placing a gripper. The virtual robot interacts with the object as in reality (Pull, push or rotate). For each successful interaction, we collect the robot’s egocentric observations before and after interaction and the object’s articulation model as training supervision. The data distribution is imbalanced due to the large proportion of negative data. To mitigate the imbalance problem, we optimize the network with the combination of the cross-entropy loss and the dice loss。 Non-maximum suppression (NMS) for peak selection select the point with the maximum score and add it to the preserving set. Suppress its neighbors by a certain distance threshold. Repeat this process until all points are added to the preserving set or suppressed. Articulation Inference Ditto: Building Digital Twins of Articulated Objects [3] The occupancy decoder is discarded. RefinementThe estimated articulation model could have a higher accuracy if the observations covered significant articulation motions and a complete view of the object’s interior. However, theseobservations may be partially occluded due to ineffective actions. eg. we find that articulation estimation of a fully opened revolute joint, like &gt;30∘&gt;30^\\circ&gt;30∘, is more accurate in terms of angle error than one with an ajar joint. Accordingly, we develop an iterative procedure of interacting with partially opened joints and refining the articulated predictions. we exploit the potential motion information from the previous articulation model and extract the object-level affordance. We refine the affordance prediction by selecting a pair of locations and actions to produce the most significant articulation motion. We set the force direction as the moment of the axis. Given the joint axis and part segment, we select the point in the predicted mobile part farthest from the joint axis as our next interaction hotspot.

AbstractNeural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have made great success in representing complex 3D scenes with high-resolution details and efficient memory. Nevertheless, current NeRF-based pose estimators have no initial pose prediction and are prone to local optima during optimization. In this paper, we present LATITUDE: Global Localization with Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter, which introduces a two-stage localization mechanism in city-scale NeRF. In place recognition stage, we train a regressor through images generated from trained NeRFs, which provides an initial value for global localization. In pose optimization stage, we minimize the residual between the observed image and rendered image by directly optimizingthe pose on the tangent plane. To avoid falling into local optimum, we introduce a Truncated Dynamic Low-pass Filter (TDLF) for coarse-to-fine pose registration. We evaluate our method on both synthetic and real-world data and show its potential applications for high-precision navigation in large scale city scenes. System Design Place Recognition Original poses, accompanied by additional poses around the original ones are sampled. The pose vector is passed through the trained and fixed Mega-NeRF with shuffled appearance embeddings. Initial poses of the inputted images are predicted by a pose regressor network. Pose Optimization The initial poses are passed through positional encoding filter The pose vector is passed through the trained and fixed Mega-NeRF and generates a rendered image. Calculate the photometric error of the rendered image and the observed image and back propagate to get a more accurate pose with the TDLF. ImplementationPlace Recognition Data Augmentation: A technique in machine learning used to reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model by training models on several slightly-modified copies of existing data. First uniformly sample several positions in a horizontal H×WH\\times WH×W rectangle area around each position around original poses Treal(xreal,qreal)T_{real}(\\mathbf x_{real},\\mathbf q_{real})Treal​(xreal​,qreal​). Then add random perturbations on each axis drawn evenly in [−θ,θ][-\\theta,\\theta][−θ,θ], where θ\\thetaθ is the max amplitude of perturbation to form sampled poses Tsyn(xsyn,qsyn)T_{syn}(\\mathbf x_{syn},\\mathbf q_{syn})Tsyn​(xsyn​,qsyn​). They are used to generate the rendered observations IsynI_{syn}Isyn​ by inputting the poses to Mega-NeRF. To avoid memory explosion, we generate the poses using the method above and use Mega-NeRF to render images during specific epochs of pose regression training. Additionally, Mega-NeRF’s appearance embeddings are selected by randomly interpolating those of the training set, which can be considered as a data augmentation technique to improve the robustness of the APR model under different lighting conditions. Pose Regressor: Absolute pose regressor (APR) networks are trained to estimate the pose of the camera given a captured image. Architecture: Built on top of VGG16’s light network structure, we use 4 full connection layers to learn pose information from image sequences. Input: Observed image IrealI_{real}Ireal​ (resolution 480×240480 \\times 240480×240), rendered observations IsynI_{syn}Isyn​ Output: Corresponding estimated poses T^real(x^real,q^real)\\hat T_{real}(\\mathbf {\\hat x}_{real},\\mathbf {\\hat q}_{real})T^real​(x^real​,q^​real​), T^syn(x^syn,q^syn)\\hat T_{syn}(\\mathbf {\\hat x}_{syn},\\mathbf {\\hat q}_{syn})T^syn​(x^syn​,q^​syn​).

Keywords: scene representation, view synthesis, image-based rendering, volume rendering, 3D deep learning A brief understanding: How to train a network for NeRFTraining a neural network for NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) involves several steps, including data preparation, network architecture design, training, and evaluation. Data preparation: The first step is to prepare the data that will be used to train the neural network. This typically involves capturing a set of 3D scans of the object or environment being represented, and labeling the data with the corresponding colors that should be associated with each point in the 3D space. Network architecture design: The next step is to design the architecture of the neural network that will be used to represent the object or environment. This typically involves defining the number and types of layers in the network, as well as the size and shape of the network. Training: Once the network architecture has been designed, the next step is to train the network using the prepared data. This involves feeding the data into the network and adjusting the weights of the network over multiple iterations, or epochs, to optimize the performance of the network. Evaluation: After the network has been trained, it is typically evaluated on a separate set of data to measure its performance and ensure that it is generating accurate results. This can involve comparing the output of the network to the ground truth data, as well as using visualization techniques to compare the rendered images produced by the network to actual photographs of the object or environment. Overall, the process of training a neural network for NeRF involves a combination of data preparation, network architecture design, training, and evaluation to produce a highly accurate and efficient 3D representation of an object or environment. ​ By Vicuna-13b Contribution An approach for representing continuous scenes with complex geometry and materials as 5D neural radiance fields, parameterized as basic MLP networks. A differentiable rendering procedure based on classical volume rendering techniques, which we use to optimize these representations from standard RGB images. This includes a hierarchical sampling strategy to allocate the MLP’s capacity towards space with visible scene content. A positional encoding to map each input 5D coordinate into a higher dimensional space, which enables us to successfully optimize neural radiance fields to represent high-frequency scene content. An overview of our neural radiance field scene representation and differentiable rendering procedure. Here g.t. represents the “ground truth”, which means the real scene. Overview of the Rendering Process March camera rays through the scene to generate a sampled set of 3D points. Use those points and their corresponding 2D viewing directions as input to the neural network to produce an output set of colors and densities. use classical volume rendering techniques to accumulate those colors and densities into a 2D image. we can use gradient descent to optimize this model by minimizing the error between each observed image and the corresponding views rendered from our representation. Neural Radiance Field Scene RepresentationThis is a method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network FΘF_\\ThetaFΘ​, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location.

We render the color of any ray passing through the scene using principles from classical volume rendering[1].

Example: In (a) and (b), we show the appearance of two fixed 3D points from two different camera positions: one on the side of the ship (orange insets) and one on the surface of the water (blue insets). Our method predicts the changing appearance of these two 3D points with respect to the direction of observation d\\mathbf dd, and in (c) we show how this behavior generalizes continuously across the whole hemisphere of viewing directions(This hemisphere can be viewed as the plot of (c,d)(\\mathbf c,\\mathbf d)(c,d), where d\\mathbf dd is the unit vector in the spherical coordinate frame and ccc shows the color). Discrete SamplingRendering a view from our continuous neural radiance field requires estimating this integral C(r)C(r)C(r) for a camera ray traced through each pixel of the desired virtual camera. However, MLP would only be queried at a discrete set of locations. So we use deterministic quadrature[3] to numerically estimate this continuous integral. we partition [tn,tf][t_n,t_f][tn​,tf​] into NNN evenly-spaced bins and then draw one sample uniformly at random from within each bin: ti∼U[tn+i−1N(tf−tn), tn+iN(tf−tn)] t_i \\sim \\mathcal{U} \\left[ t_n + \\frac{i-1}{N}(t_f-t_n),\\,\\, t_n + \\frac{i}{N}(t_f-t_n) \\right]\\ ti​∼U[tn​+Ni−1​(tf​−tn​),tn​+Ni​(tf​−tn​)] From Scene to Object: Estimation of C(r)C(\\mathbf r)C(r)(ci,ri)→C^(r)=∑i=1NTi(1−exp⁡(−σiδi))ci (c_i,r_i)\\rightarrow \\hat C(\\mathbf r)=\\sum_{i=1}^{N}T_i (1-\\exp({-\\sigma_i \\delta_i})) \\mathbf{c}_i (ci​,ri​)→C^(r)=i=1∑N​Ti​(1−exp(−σi​δi​))ci​ Ti=exp⁡(−∑j=1i−1σjδj) T_i=\\exp(- \\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \\sigma_j \\delta_j) Ti​=exp(−j=1∑i−1​σj​δj​) δi=ti+1−ti\\delta_i=t_{i+1}-t_iδi​=ti+1​−ti​ : The distance between adjacent samples This function for calculating C^(r)\\hat{C}(\\mathbf{r})C^(r) from the set of (ci,σi)(\\mathbf{c}_i, \\sigma_i)(ci​,σi​) values is trivially differentiable and reduces to traditional alpha compositing[4] with alpha values αi=1−exp⁡(−σiδi)\\alpha_i = 1-\\exp(-\\sigma_i \\delta_i)αi​=1−exp(−σi​δi​).

Reducing the Cost with Hierarchical SamplingOur rendering strategy of densely evaluating the neural radiance field network at NNN query points along each camera ray is inefficient: free space and occluded regions that do not contribute to the rendered image are still sampled repeatedly. Instead of just using a single network to represent the scene, we simultaneously optimize two networks: one “coarse’’ and one “fine’’.

ConclusionTODO Explanations [1] Volume rendering is a technique used in computer graphics and computer vision to visualize 3D data sets as 2D images. It works by slicing the 3D data set into a series of thin layers, and then rendering each layer as a 2D image from a specific viewpoint. These 2D images are then composited together to form the final volume rendering. [2] If a distribution (here in 3D space) has a density f(x,y,z)f(x,y,z)f(x,y,z), that means that for (almost) any volume in that space VVV, you can assign a probability to it by integrating the density (here “density” means probability per unit volume, very similar to, say, the concentration of salt in a solution). [3] Deterministic quadrature is a mathematical method used to estimate the definite integral of a function. The basic idea is to divide the area under the curve into smaller areas, and calculate the approximate value of the definite integral by summing the areas of the smaller areas. There are several types of deterministic quadrature methods, including the trapezoidal rule, Simpson’s rule, and Gaussian quadrature. [4] Alpha compositing is a technique used in computer graphics and image processing to combine two or more images or video frames by blending them together using an alpha channel. The alpha channel is a mask that defines the transparency or opacity of each pixel in the image. Alpha compositing is used to create composites, where the resulting image is a combination of the original images, with the transparency or opacity of each image controlled by the alpha channel. The alpha channel can be used to create effects such as blending, fading, and layering. Alpha compositing - Wikipedia [5] Inverse transform sampling (ITS) is a technique used in digital signal processing to reconstruct a signal from a set of samples. It is the inverse of the discrete Fourier transform(DFT). The basic idea behind ITS is to use the Fourier coefficients obtained from DFT to reconstruct the signal in the time domain.
